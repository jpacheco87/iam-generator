### 4. Policy Optimization
- **Location**: `backend/iam_generator/enhanced_services.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /enhanced/optimize-policy`
- **Features**:
  - Policy size reduction
  - Statement consolidation
  - Action pattern optimization
  - Security improvements
  - Validation integration

### 5. Compliance Checking

- **API Endpoint**: `POST /enhanced/compliance-check/{framework}`
- **Features**:
  - SOC2 Type II compliance
  - PCI DSS compliance
  - HIPAA Security Rule compliance
  - GDPR Article 32 compliance
  - Scoring and recommendations

### 6. Security Recommendations
- **Location**: `backend/app/routers/enhanced.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /enhanced/security-recommendations/{service}`
- **Features**:
  - Service-specific best practices
  - Common vulnerability patterns
  - Recommended IAM conditions
  - Security enhancement suggestions

### 7. Policy Templates
- **Location**: `backend/app/routers/enhanced.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /enhanced/policy-templates/{use_case}`
- **Features**:
  - Pre-built policy templates
  - Common use case patterns
  - Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS templates
  - Customization guidance

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Integration Tests ✅
All enhanced features pass comprehensive integration testing:

```
✅ Policy validation working correctly
✅ Cross-service dependencies working correctly
✅ Conditional policy generation working correctly
✅ Compliance check working correctly
✅ Security recommendations working correctly
✅ Policy templates working correctly
✅ Policy optimization working correctly
```

### Example Functionality Demonstrations

#### Policy Validation
- Input: Policy with wildcard permissions
- Output: Score 65/100, detected critical security issues
- Recommendations provided for improvement

#### Cross-Service Dependencies
- Input: `lambda invoke --function-name my-function`
- Output: 3 services, 24 additional permissions detected
- Dependencies: VPC, CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, DLQ, Layers

#### Conditional Policy Generation
- Input: S3 commands with MFA, IP, and time restrictions
- Output: Policy with proper IAM conditions applied
- Security enhancements documented

#### Compliance Check (SOC2)
- Input: Policy with secure transport and specific actions
- Output: 66% compliance score, detailed pass/fail analysis
- Specific recommendations for MFA implementation
